# MyReads Project

This is a Udacity React project that helped introduce me to concepts including: Composition, Unidirectional Data Flow, React Components, JSX,
State Management, Life Cycle, React Router, and PropTypes.

MyReads is an application that displays books categorized into three *shelves*: "Currently Reading", "Want To Read", and "Read".  It allows a user to move a book between the 3 shelves, search a book, and add a book from the search results to one of the shelves.

Most of the code was provided as a [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) by Udacity and my work was done in the following components: App.js, Book.js, BookSearch.js, BookShelf.js. A backend server is provided by Udacity which my application makes calls to via methods in BooksAPI.js.  As noted in the template repo, search is limited to a set of [search terms](https://github.com/marvinsjsu/myreads/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md).

To install and run the application:
- `git clone git@github.com:marvinsjsu/myreads.git`
- `cd myreads` 
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
